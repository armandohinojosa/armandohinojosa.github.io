      <p class="reflection">
        During my 9th-grade English class, I created a book report on "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley. This project involved designing a detailed slideshow that included elements such as character analysis, summaries, themes, and fun facts. The goal was to analyze the central themes of the book, summarize key ideas, and present the information effectively. Through this project, I demonstrated my computer skills by creating visually appealing slides, my communication skills through public speaking, and my professionalism through confident and well-organized presentations. Although I initially struggled with nervousness while speaking to the class, I overcame this by focusing on smaller groups within the audience. This experience helped me grow by improving my public speaking and presentation skills, which I plan to use in the future for delivering impactful presentations and communicating effectively with larger audiences.
