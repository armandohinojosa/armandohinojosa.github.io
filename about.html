        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Armando Hinojosa, and I am a high school student with a passion for motorsports, engineering, and technology. My dream is to become a motorsport engineer and contribute to the innovation and performance of high-speed vehicles. I am a determined and creative individual who loves solving problems and exploring new ideas. My hobbies include programming, kart racing, and experimenting with new technologies. I also enjoy playing video games and solving puzzles, which help me sharpen my critical thinking skills. My family and friends have been a constant source of support throughout my journey, with my father being a role model who has taught me the importance of hard work, perseverance, and staying true to my goals. Outside of school, I dedicate my time to activities that align with my passion for motorsports and engineering, such as kart racing, learning programming languages, building small projects, and staying updated on the latest advancements in automotive technology. Over the past four years of high school, I have grown significantly both academically and personally, learning to manage my time effectively, collaborate with others, and tackle challenges with a problem-solving mindset. These experiences have prepared me to take on the rigorous demands of pursuing a career in motorsport engineering. My ultimate goal is to become a motorsport engineer, working on cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of performance and innovation. To achieve this, I plan to pursue a degree in mechanical or automotive engineering, with a focus on motorsport applications. In the next few years, I aim to attend a university with a strong engineering program and opportunities for hands-on experience in motorsports. I also plan to participate in student racing teams and internships to gain practical knowledge and build a network within the industry. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my aspirations. I am excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead in the world of motorsport engineering. Feel free to explore the rest of my portfolio to see my projects and achievements!
